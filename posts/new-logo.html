<p>I recently redesigned my website to look a little nicer than it did.
I'm no designer (although I'm trying to learn) but I think it turned out nicely.</p>
<p>Discounting the minor font and color changes, the biggest difference between
the old version and this new redesign is the logo. </p>
<p class="wide-content"><img alt="The new logo" src="/static/img/oldlogo2x.png"></p>
<p>I was playing around with Photoshop late one night last week when I hit upon the 
idea. My old tagline was <code>Student / Hacker / Human</code>; the new logo incorporates these
three nouns and puts me right at the intersection. I chose the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK">CMYK color scheme</a> because it also involves the
overlap of three different things to create a fourth.</p>
<h3>Student</h3>
<p>I'm not happy unless I'm learning new things. I aim to be a student in all areas of life &#8212;
there's always more to learn. Although I may know a little about certain subjects, there's
always <a href="http://www.skeenan.com/">other</a> <a href="http://web.mit.edu/cepstein/www/">people</a> who
know a lot more than I do. It would simply be foolish to not try to learn as much as I can
from anyone willing to teach me.</p>
<h3>Hacker</h3>
<p>No, I don't try to break into people's computers or steal their money. I just really like to
make cool things. Right now I've been hacking mostly on <a href="https://github.com/peterldowns">software</a>
but I'd love to learn how to make more physical things. Probably the coolest hacker I know is <a href="http://www.pauldowns.com/AboutUs.asp">my father, Paul
Downs</a>. He owns his own furniture company,
writes for the New York Times' <a href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/author/paul-downs/">small business blog</a>, 
and is constantly working on cool projects. Although I can't make things with my hands like he
can, I hope to learn how at some point.</p>
<h3>Human</h3>
<p>There are a lot of people who like to learn, and also a lot of people who make cool things. I don't
claim to be unique in being human, but I think that I'm different than a lot of people working
in programming / tech in that I have interests outside of writing software. I really enjoy programming,
but I also really like hanging out with my friends, running, going on bike rides, or just relaxing and
listening to music. I have fairly decent social skills and I like to meet new people. This is just as important
to me as making cool things or learning. No one wants to teach assholes, nor listen to them brag
about their accomplishments. The best way to learn a lot and find an audience for the things you make is
to play well with others.</p></div>
