<p class="wide-content"><img alt="iTunes Playlists" src="/static/img/itunes-playlists.png"></p>
<p>Here's a recommendation: create playlists, keep track of when you do so, and
never delete them. I started doing this in 2011; 2 years and 45 playlists later
I've decided to write about how this has affected me. This is more of a
personal post than usual, but if you're interested in music and emotion then
please read on.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I listen to a lot of music. I used to play the violin, but I gave it up when I
started highschool.  I was briefly attracted to the electric bass, but I never
got any good. I had more fun repurposing an old radio as an amplifier head than
badly covering The Beatles.</p>
<p>All of my friends and I actively listen to music. By this I mean that we seek
out certain artists instead of settling for whatever comes on the radio. I
started going to concerts my freshman year of highschool, stopped my junior
year, and have just recently taken it up again. I've always listened to music
while reading, working, writing, and programming. Especially programming
&#8212; it's a great way to drown out the distractions of an open office, and
because I make my living on the computer I spend a lot of time listening to
different artists.</p>
<h3>Memories</h3>
<p>Certain songs mean a lot to me because of the context in which I first heard
them.  Guster will always remind me of my freshman year of highschool; Crystal
Fighters reminds me of the summer; Arcade Fire's "The Suburbs" reminds me of my
first serious relationship. I don't think I'm the only one who associates
different songs or albums with different memories. I have no idea why it
happens, but music seems tied to my emotions. When I listen to playlists I've
made in the past, I feel how I did when they were created. </p>
<h3>Replay</h3>
<p>I've created about 2 playlists each month for the past two years, and each one
has a specific date and a short description. Because I've done this, I can now
"replay" my emotions at any time from that period, which I think is
unbelievably cool. It's also been very cathartic &#8212; I can selectively
return to a playlist I made while angry, or depressed, or elated, and reason
about those emotions much more logically now that I'm removed from the
particular situations by which they were triggered.</p>
<p>It's also fun to revisit the past, and to see how much my tastes and emotions
have changed since then. I've spent the past year working in San Francisco,
which has been hard because I don't have many friends my own age here (I moved
from Philadelphia, and all of my highschool friends are attending college.)
Listening to music that reminds me of my old friends and the times we've had
together did a lot to help me adjust to my relatively lonely life here on the
west coast.</p>
<p>Saving my playlists has been an interesting and overwhelmingly positive
experience. I've found that I tend to feel the need for a new playlist every 2
or 3 weeks, but there's no hard rule. If you try this for yourself, be sure to
write and let me know how it goes!</p>
