<p>Last month I decided to buy some bitcoin. Why? The price was going up! I was
guaranteed to make some money! What could go wrong?</p>
<h3>What is this stuff?</h3>
<p>Well, not quite like that. Bitcoin has interested me for a while &#8212; what
currency has been the subject of such speculation? How often do new currencies
become popular enough to actually use? Or has such a <a href="https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/">mysterious
creator</a>
(or group of creators)? </p>
<p>So I decided to buy some bitcoin. I knew that it was likely I would lose some
money, but hey, maybe the price would keep going up! At the time I was visiting
some friends in Chicago so I didn't have very regular internet access, but I
thought it would be a good time. The price had been rocketing upwards and I
wanted to get in before it was "too late". </p>
<h3>Getting in too late</h3>
<p class="wide-content"><img alt="Bitcoin
Chart" src="http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/chart.png?width=940&amp;m=mtgoxUSD&amp;SubmitButton=Draw&amp;r=60&amp;i=&amp;c=0&amp;s=&amp;e=&amp;Prev=&amp;Next=&amp;t=M&amp;b=&amp;a1=&amp;m1=10&amp;a2=&amp;m2=25&amp;x=0&amp;i1=&amp;i2=&amp;i3=&amp;i4=&amp;v=1&amp;cv=0&amp;ps=0&amp;l=0&amp;p=0&amp;"></p>
<p>Take a look at that chart. Always ahead of the trend, I put in my order on April
2nd. Because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of signing up with an
exchange, I purchased my coins through <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, a
YC-funded start-up that seems to make money on bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the trade was delayed due to Coinbase's limited ability to handle the
recent interest in bitcoin, and my purchase ended up being exercised on
April 9th, at the <em>peak</em> of the madness. For around $650, I purchased 2.7
bitcoins. I checked the price the next day... hooray, I'm poor!</p>
<h3>A lesson learned</h3>
<p>I knew that buying bitcoin was going to be risky, but now I can
truly say that I've lost money via speculation. Hopefully it will prevent me
from similarly dumb investments in the future. In my defense, I only purchased
bitcoin with the understanding that my money was about to dissappear forever. I
consider this lesson to have been worth the price.</p>
<h4>Bonus points: what should a pirate do with his coins?</h4>
<p>Having exhausted my willingness to lose money speculating on bitcoin's value,
I've recently explored using it as a currency. Bitcoin seems to be good for
buying shady things, so I attempted to purchase a "novelty ID" from the fine
folks at <a href="http://idchief.info/">ID Chief</a>.</p>
<p>So I took a nice photo, scanned a signature, gave them the name and home
address of one of my friends, and sent them some bitcoin. Although
communicative while helping me pay them, I haven't heard anything since. Fellow
youth of America: stay in school, work hard, and don't trust strangers on the
internet who sell fake IDs for anonymous currencies.</p></div>
