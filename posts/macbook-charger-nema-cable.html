<p>I just moved in to my apartment in Helsinki, where I'm going to be spending the summer working for <a href="https://smartly.io">Smartly</a>, and realized that I don't have any kind of power adapter for my laptop charger. Bummer. Luckily my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-keenan-47387055">Sean</a> used to work for Apple and told me a handy trick: any NEMA 1-15P cable will fit into the macbook's charging brick. Luckily the small speakers in this apartment had just such a cable. </p>
<p class="wide-content"><img alt="NEMA to Brick in action" src="/static/img/nema-to-macbrick.jpg"></p>
<p>(No, he didn't refer to the cable as a NEMA 1-15P cable, that took extensive internet research. I always knew it by the name of "black power cable thing... no not the one for monitors and computers.")</p>
<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/386246/hack-your-mac-laptop-power-cord">Lifehacker</a> also has a writeup but I took my own picture and figured out the cable name so I feel perfectly justified in publishing this myself.</p></div>
