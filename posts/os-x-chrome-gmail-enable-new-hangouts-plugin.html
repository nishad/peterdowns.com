<p>Recently, my friend Anvita tried sending me a chat message over Google's
Hangouts, using the chat box that shows up in Gmail. While I was able to
respond to her messages, she always appeared offline to me, and I to her. We
noticed that I was still on Google Talk, not Google Hangouts, which ended up
being the issue. Should be a simple fix: follow <a href="https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/3115176">the instructions in this
Google support note</a>, click
on a "Try the new Hangouts" link, and be done.</p>
<p class="wide-content"><img alt='"Try the new Hangouts"' src="/static/img/try_hangouts_cnet.png"></p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>But that button didn't appear for me; googling (ha) turned up that a few other
people were having the same issue. After some debugging, here's the
explanation: the latest versions of chrome disable the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation">NPAPI
interface</a>. This should
be fine, since the Hangout plugin shouldn't use that deprecated API, but
apparently it does. And even though I had the old Google Voice and Video plugin
installed, it wasn't being used, since NPAPI was deprecated. I'm pretty sure
this is the bug because when I tried Safari, I was prompted to allow the Google
Voice and Video plugin, and once I did the "Try the new Hangouts" link showed
up and everything worked perfectly.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>All hope is not lost: for now, the solution is to go to
<a href="chrome://flags/">chrome://flags</a> and enable the "Enable NPAPI" option.</p>
<p class="wide-content"><img alt="Enable NPAPI" src="/static/img/enable_npapi.jpg"></p>
<p>I say for now, because this option will be removed with Chrome 45. Hopefully
this helps someone out in the meantime.</p></div>
