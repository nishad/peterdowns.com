      <div class="post"><h1>Trying Something New (My Week With Node.js)</h1>
<p>Last Wednesday I sat down and wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to try something new. Even though I was accepted to university way back in November, I've been pretty busy all year keeping up with my schoolwork. Now, as classes wind down, I find myself with a little free time. Tomorrow [Thursday, May 3] I don't need to go in to school at all. I could spend the day studying for the final exam I must take on Friday &#8212; that would probably be the safest decision &#8212; or I could try something new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result is a web-app I call <a href="http://wwikt-peterldowns.dotcloud.com"><strong>Who Will I Know There?</strong></a> I think it's pretty neat (it's a tool for finding friends to connect with when you're moving somewhere new) and I hope you do, too.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I often feel as though I'm stuck in a rut with programming. I'll work feverishly on a project for weeks (or months), and then sit back and build nothing for a while. </p>
<p>This has become less frequent as I've grown older, which is nice. I hate not building cool things. Last Wednesday I decided that I'd try to hack on a new project for a week, in a language I'd never used before (node.js) and see what I could come up with.</p>
<p>I hadn't built anything in a while and I realized that I also hadn't learned anything new in a while, either. Learning new things is important to me, so I decided to give it a go: one week, one new language, one (hopefully) completed project.</p>
<p>(actually, I gave myself 12 hours, but I didn't come up with anything worth sharing after that time).</p>
<h3>Node.js was a great choice</h3>
<p>I'm still terribly inexperienced when it comes to programming. What little I've done has mostly been in Python and C. I've built a couple of web apps with Python (see: <a href="http://bookshrink.com">Bookshrink</a>, <a href="http://headliner-peterldowns.dotcloud.com">Headliner</a>), but this time I decided to go with something a little different: <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell it's an awesome language. I'm still getting used to it, and at first I definitely felt as if I were simply writing python with slightly different syntax. It's expressive, it's C-like, and although I don't fully understand the differences in equality testing (<code>===</code> and <code>!==</code> vs. <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>???) it's been easy to pick up.</p>
<p>Probably the best thing about Node is that it lets me use javascript for both client side and server side logic. All those little mistakes I used to make when I'd try to write something in Javascript using Python syntax or vice versa are now gone &#8212; there's no need to switch between two different languages.</p>
<p>Other than that, the biggest compliment I have is that Node was very easy to learn and use (with the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> MVC framework and <a href="http://dotcloud.com">Dotcloud</a> for hosting) to get a website up and running very quickly. Prototyping and making changes has been painless, especially because I decided to use Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> framework-y thing.</p>
<h3>The result &#8212; Who Will I Know There?</h3>
<p>It's pretty hard for me to hack on something I'm not interested in. So I wanted to build something that would mostly help <em>me</em> out, although it being useful to other people would be a nice bonus.</p>
<p>I recently decided to defer my admission to university for an entire year and spend that time working at a Bay Area-based startup instead. The people at the startup are all far more intelligent than I am, and the experience will teach me just as much (probably more) than university would.</p>
<p>The problem is that the job is in the Bay Area. I'm from Philadelphia, and although I have some family in California, I have no friends in California for me to hang out with. I wondered if I could come up with some sort of application to search my Facebook friends find those who might be able to introduce me to cool people.</p>
<p>I linked to it at the beginning of this post, but <a href="http://wwikt-peterldowns.dotcloud.com">Who Will I Know There</a> is that application. I learned a lot while making it, and I think it's pretty slick, but I'd love to hear any feedback you may have! Please do go give it a try and let me know what you think!</p></div>
