<p>Hello. As you can see in the side bar, my name is Peter. I like to read, run, and program, but now I'm starting to write, too. This is my blog. I'm going to try to update it pretty often; for the past year I've been keeping a list of ideas about which I'd like to write.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I've been meaning to start a blog for a while. I haven't gone through with it &#8212; I never really liked tumblr, or blogger, or any other blogging system. I think that writing is important, and that I should start contributing something online instead of just reading posts on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">hacker news</a> and <a href="http://boingboing.net">boingboing</a>. Plus, writing is fun, and I want to become better at it.</p>
<p>So, here's the blog.</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>I'm using <a href="http://bottlepy.org">bottle.py</a> to deal with <code>HTTP</code> requests. CSS3 and the <a href="cssgrid.net">1140px grid</a> make the layout pretty simple. </p>
<p>The posts are all written in Markdown and converted using the python <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">markdown module</a> on pypi. The HTML for each post is stored in one large JSON dictionary which is queried when you come to the site. I thought about using a database but really there's no reason to do so.</p>
<p>If you'd like to look at it (or even contribute a post!), <a href="https://github.com/peterldowns/website">all of the code is available on my github</a>.</p></div>
