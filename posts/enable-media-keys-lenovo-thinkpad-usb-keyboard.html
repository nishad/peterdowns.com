<p>Some time in 2013 I switched to using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ThinkPad-USB-Keyboard-with-TrackPoint/dp/B002ONCC6G">Lenovo Thinkpad USB
Keyboard</a> as my main programming
keyboard. I did so for a few reasons: its keys are simultaneously cushy and
responsive; it has a dedicated right-click button; and the <a href="http://xkcd.com/243/">trackpoint
mouse</a> is extremely useful for making quick mousing
gestures without lifting my hands from the keyboard.</p>
<p>When I left my job in June 2014 I had to leave the keyboard at work.
Unfortunately, in my quest for a replacement I learned that it is now nearly
impossible to purchase one for a reasonable price. I was forced to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F3U4TQS/">the
updated version</a>, which has the
advantage of being simulatenously reasonably priced and easily purchasable via
Amazon (one of my all-time favorite combinations of attributes.)</p>
<p>The new model gets rid of the extended palm rests of the original and switches
to a chiclet-style keyboard that I have ended up liking (despite my initial
concerns) even more than the old-school keys on the first version. The only
downside is that there is no longer a dedicated way to send media keys
(previous, play/pause, forward) like there used to be. The original keyboard
would send media keys when you held the function key and pressed an arrow key.
This was great, I was happy, and the key events being sent worked just like the
dedicated keys on my Macbook Air's keyboard.</p>
<p>The solution is simple but non-obvious. First, install
<a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/">Karabiner</a>. Open that up and
enable the setting below:</p>
<p class="wide-content"><img alt="Karabiner settings" src="/static/img/karabiner-settings.png"></p>
<p>There you go &#8211;&#160;now <code>F10</code>, <code>F11</code>, and <code>F12</code> will work as media keys.  I took a
look at adding a <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/xml.html.en">custom key
definition</a> to change this to <code>fn
+ &lt;arrow key&gt;</code>, but I was unable to get it to work. Pressing a naked arrow key
sends <code>fn + &lt;arrow key&gt;</code> to the computer; holding <code>fn</code> and pressing
<code>&lt;arrow key&gt;</code> does not send <em>any</em> keys to the computer. Also strange: I was
unable to get the keyboard's <code>FnLk</code> setting to work, so each of the <code>F&lt;1-12&gt;</code>
keys are being sent to the computer as <code>fn + &lt;F key&gt;</code>. If you don't believe me
you can play around in the event viewer &#8211;&#160;if anyone has an explanation of this
or a workaround I'd be happy to share it here. In the meantime, I'm happy to
have <em>any</em> working media keys.</p></div>
