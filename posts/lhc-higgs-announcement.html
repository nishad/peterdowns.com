<h3>An article for <a href="http://www.hhsbanner.com/">The Harriton Banner</a></h3>
<h4><em>note: this was written as a general overview of the 12/06/2011 CERN presentation. I've attempted to write it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_English">Simplified English</a>, for no reason in particular.</em></h4>
<p>Just around a month before this was written some smart people held a talk about something called the Higgs Boson. If you read science news you may have even heard something about it, because it was surrounded by a lot of media hype (ok, a relatively large amount for the world of particle physics.)</p>
<p>These smart people are researchers at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and they had been (and still are) trying to figure out if a certain particle (the Higgs Boson) exists. Just like any scientists, they use tools to do their work; unlike most other scientists, their tool has a fancy name (the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC) and is 27 kilometers long. </p>
<p>The LHC is the world's largest particle collider. Using superconducting magnets, along with a <em>lot</em> of physics knowledge, scientists are able to smash clouds of tiny particles together. The LHC is able to smash things together with much more energy than any other collider in the world. </p>
<p>The reason the LHC exists is to tell us more about the way the world works, particularly at a subatomic level. Currently, the way scientists generally agree that things are is described by the <em>Standard Model</em>. In a way it represents the pinnacle of human achievement: it contains all of our knowledge of the universe, from big to small.</p>
<p>Although the Standard Model does a pretty good job of explaining real-world events, some of the predictions it makes about smaller particles are hard to test. For instance, you probably know that all of the things you deal with on an everyday basis (car, computer, schoolbooks, baseball, etc.) have mass. You may even know that mass is a measure of an object's resistance to change in its speed.</p>
<p>Maybe if you've studied some more physics you've learned that mass is relative when the object being massed is in motion. You may have learned that mass is essentially equal to something called rest energy - this is what Einstein described with the equation "E=mc^2".</p>
<p>But no matter how much you learned about mass in the previous paragraph, I'm certain that you don't know <em>why</em> things have mass. That's because no one knows why things have mass, including scientists. The experiments they've performed don't show any one reason that things should have mass.</p>
<p>This hasn't stopped scientists from coming up with theories, though. One scientist, Peter Higgs, suggests that mass is dependent on the existence of a subatomic particle which is commonly referred to as the Higgs Boson. This theory is popular enough (and the science behind it sound enough) that it is included in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>The LHC exists for many reasons, but one of its principal goals is to determine whether or not the Higgs Boson exists. The least surprising discovery would be that the Higgs Boson exists and the Standard Model is still true. </p>
<p>The other possibility would be for the scientists running the experiments to not be able to find any hint of its existence. This would be a real wrench in the gears of our scientific knowledge: it would mean that the Standard Model got something wrong, despite accurately describing almost every other interaction in the universe. And if the Standard Model is wrong about this one little thing, it may just be chance that it's right about so many others.</p>
<p>This being said, scientists around the world were excited to hear that the CERN researchers investigating the Higgs Boson had something important to say about it. On December 6th, 2011, the researchers held a press conference that said two important things: that if the Higgs were to be found, it would probably be found to exist with a mass between 115 and 131 GeV; that data from two different detectors at the LHC resemble what scientists would expect to see from a Higgs Boson between 126 and 124 GeV. </p>
<p>It is important to realize that they are not sure that the Higgs exists. According to the data they've analyzed, there's around a 1 in 1000 chance that what the data shows is merely a coincidence. This is actually, important. Although you and I would say "Wow, that is phenomenally unlikely, I bet that the Higgs Boson exists," a .1% chance of error in a particle physics finding is not strong enough to imply a conclusive result. So there's a chance that no, they're wrong, the Higgs hasn't been proven to exist yet. But many scientists feel that more experimentation will only agree with the results the CERN researchers presented. </p>
