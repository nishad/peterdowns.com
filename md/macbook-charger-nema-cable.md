# Macbook Charger with a NEMA 1-15P Cable

I just moved in to my apartment in Helsinki, where I'm going to be spending the summer working for [Smartly](https://smartly.io), and realized that I don't have any kind of power adapter for my laptop charger. Bummer. Luckily my friend [Sean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-keenan-47387055) used to work for Apple and told me a handy trick: any NEMA 1-15P cable will fit into the macbook's charging brick. Luckily the small speakers in this apartment had just such a cable.

(No, he didn't refer to the cable as a NEMA 1-15P cable, that took extensive internet research. I always knew it by the name of "black power cable thing... no not the one for monitors and computers.")

[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/386246/hack-your-mac-laptop-power-cord) also has a writeup but I took my own picture and figured out the cable name so I feel perfectly justified in publishing this myself.
